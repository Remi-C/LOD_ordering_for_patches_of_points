--This script has function to order a pointcloud following the points closest to the center of octree cells
--
--------------------------------------



-------------------------------
--Ordering points by an octree approach
--
--Given a lcoalized point cloud, we propose a way to order the points based on their  XYZ coordinnates, following an octree approach, 
--where we try to  have for each level a uniform repartition in space of ordered points.
--That is , for each level of an octree, we keep a point per cell whih is the closest to the center of the cell.
--
--
--inside a level points are ordered randomly (more intelligent ordering may be preferable, like a defined pattern which gives some assurance about distribution)
--We could use a Z curb ordering and inverting (read right to left) the binary representation. 
--
--This is achieved with several function, with the top function being public.rc_OrderByOcTree( pointsTable regclass, tot_tree_level INT,OUT result_per_level int[]);
--
--and an intermediate function being public.rc_OrderByOcTreeL( pointsTable text,  tree_level INT, tot_tree_level INT);
--
--this function will return oid of points with an int giving the order for all asked level + the number of points found per level. 
-- All levels will be computed except if a level has less points than the preceding level
--
--	this function expects a table with         | oid::int | x::float | y::float | z::float | ord | level
--
------------
--How does it works?
------
--	for a given tree level, we are going to compute x_bf and y_bf and z_bf, meaning x_binary_full. This are x  (y,z) translated by -min_x (-min_y, -min_z), scaled by (max_x-min_x)2^tree_depth.
--	this means x_bf (y_bf, z_bf) are, when considering binary representation , the path allong a perfect Octree covering ((min_x,min_y,min_z),(max_x,max_y,max_z). 
--	For instance, x_bf = B'0110' means the first LOD is the bottom square, the second LOD the upper square, the third LOD the bottom square, the 4th LOD the upper square.
--	doing the same think for y_bf, and z_bf we get the localisation of the points for each  Octree level.
--
--
--
--For a given L level, we can compute the localisation of the point simply by shifting the binary number to the right by L, then to the left by L. 
--	this is x_bl for x_ binary_level
--	Example  : x = B'10011101', L=3 x_bl = B'10011000', this amount to truncate the L last binary digits. In the decimal world, it amounts to something like 
--	 x_l = x_f - x_f%(2^L), where % is the modulo and ^ the power. 
--
--finally, we compute x_bm and y_bm and z_bm, for x_binary_middle.
--	this is the coordinate of the middle point of the square for a given point and a given level.
--	per construction, this is the target point, ie, we would like, for each level, to find real points as close as possible to this target points.
--	There are 2^L middle points per level (1 per square)
--	The formula to compute the middle points is : 
--		x_bm :=x_bl + 2^(tot_tree_level-tree_level-1) , with tot_tree_level being the total depth of quad tree, and tree_level being the current depth of quad tree.
--
--We want to find the points closest to target points. For all the points in point cloud, we compute the distance between the x_bf,y_bf and the middle point x_bm,y_bm.
--	This distance is computed using the square norme distance, that is
--	GREATEST(@(x_bm-x_bf),@(y_bm-y_bf) );, where @ is the absolute value. 
--	This norm is ideal for what we want because all points in the miniml square (max level) will have the same distance to a point. 
--	This is very coherent with the idea of the algorithm and avoid rounding issues, as well as allow fast computation.
--	Of course the distance computing is only done for the points in the cell, points outside cannot be candidate.
--
--In the implementation all these computing are united in one function
--
--Then we select the closest point based on that distance. For this we tried 2 methods :
--	first one is using windows function that, for each line, give the oid of the closest point within a square. Then we group by this oid.
--	the other option is to use a custom aggregates : we group by square, then for each group, 
--	we return one line with the oid of the min distance to middle point of this square, or nothing if no points.
--
--
--We have now the points closest to middle points for each square, or nothing when the square is empty. 
--Now we order the points following either a custom order (reverse(x_bf), Z curve space curve with smart modulo game), or a random order.

--
------------------------------
--@TODO  : improvements :
--the current version is slow (6.5 sec for a level for 100k points).
--we could ptotentially divide computing time by 3 for a level, and gain a lot for multi-level computing (storing x_bf,y_bf)
--
--Here are the suggested test for improvments
--
--	Ideally,  function computing the "x_b*" and "distance" would be written in C or a fast procedural langage.
--
--	the min table computing is slow, all the min/max are computed separatly, we could compute it in the same custom aggregate function, so as to reduce the computing time.
--	the min computing takes about 10% of the total time.
--	--note : tried with a custom aggregate plpgsql function : slower. Would need a custom aggreegate C function !
--
--	There may be interest in using indexes.
--	
--	In the perspective of computing all the level each time (and not juste one), the computing of x_bf, y_bf should be separate and stored in columns in the table so as to be reused.
--	There is no point in comuting x_bf,y_bf L time (L being the choosen depth of the quad tree).
